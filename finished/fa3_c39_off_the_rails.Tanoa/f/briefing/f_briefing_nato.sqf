<br/>
Syndikat have been using train stations around Tanoa to transport weapons and ammunition. This pipeline of weapons and ammunition is essential to their operations across the Horizon Islands. Unfortunately, NATO are too busy squabbling with CSAT, and the Tanoan Armed Forces are too busy arguing with each other about how disgusting their mismatched camo is. That's where we come in - the Tanoan Government has hired our private military company to strike the train stations.

<font size='18'>ENEMY FORCES</font>

Syndikat thugs - shouldn't be too much in the way of heavy fortifications or weapons.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>FRIENDLY FORCES</font>
<br/>
Our two squads, plus a team of engineers.
